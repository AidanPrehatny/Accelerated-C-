// 10-1 rewrite the student grading program from 9.6/166 to generate letter grades
// 10-2 rewrite the median function from 8.1.1/140 so that we can call it wit either a vector or a build in array. the function should allow containers of any arithmetic type
// 10-3 write a test program to verify that the median function operates correctly. Ensure that calling median does not change the order of the elements in the container.
// 10-4 write a class that implements a list that holds strings
// 10-5 write a bidirectional iterator for your String_list class
// 10-6 test the class by rewriting the split function to put its output into a String_list
